scraper:
  - Hello! This lil' app will scrape search results from [Contractor Talk](https://www.contractortalk.com/). Enter the words you'd like to search for below. 
  - When ready, hit scrape. The app will first grab each page of search results, and then go back and scrape each post from those pages. Enjoy!

analyze:
  - Here, we will attempt to cluster posts together based on their similarity. We'll first try a sophisticated method, requesting embedding vectors from OpenAI. These are the same numerical representations that power ChatGPT.
  - We'll also compare those results to a more basic technique, creating vectors that count how often a word appears in a post versus how often it appears in all posts.

tfidf:
  - Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a more "traditional" metric for quantifying text data, one that predates large language models (LLMs). It measures the ratio of how often a word appears in a particular document versus how often it appears in all documents.
  - The OpenAI embeddings retain knowledge their models have learned from all of the text data they have ever consumed. This simpler method compares these scraped posts only to themselves.
